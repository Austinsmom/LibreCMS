### Setup:
LibreCMS uses PHP's PDO for Database integration. So all you need to do, is use a Database Engine that's compatible with PDO. Then import the "libre.sql" file found in the "core/" folder, then edit the "config.ini" file in the "core/" folder.
Remember to set the appropriate file and folder permissions for security purposes, and make sure "media" uses 0755 so files can be uploaded when uploading, editing or creating content.
To Login into the Administration area, goto http://yoursite/admin/ or use the "Administration" link at the bottom of the page. The default "Username/Password" is set to "admin/admin", we recommend changing this on a live site.

### TODO:
- Build Installer to make Installation Easier, and Checking PHP Components are Installed to Allow LibreCMS to work.
- Make sure database backup works properly, last time we checked it wasn't.
- Convert from font icons to using svg icons to reduce footprint.
- Reduce the Template System Markup to make it easier to use.
- Add Content to the Wiki Pages on how to use LibreCMS and how to create Templates.
- Once at a Stable Platform, create a release candidate, and create a proper gh-page site.
- Create Free Templates.
- Testing, and Bug Squashing, as per the usual with ongoing projects.
