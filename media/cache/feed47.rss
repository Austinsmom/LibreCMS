<p>This is a short post. A short post to wish you and yours a very Merry Christmas (or Happy Holidays if you prefer) and to thank you for reading this year.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;ve read every post or just one, I thank you for being interested in my words. I hope they have helped you become more successful at whatever you do.</p>
<p>While I have you..</p>
<h3>I&#8217;m taking a bloggy break</h3>
<p>This is a brilliant time to take a break from work as that&#8217;s just what everyone else is doing too!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be offline from this week (that&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m technically not working right now) through until mid-January 2017.</p>
<p>Even though I&#8217;ll technically be offline, I&#8217;ll be posting a new blog in the first week in January 2017 then it&#8217;s bloggy business as usual! Hurrah!</p>
<h3>But there&#8217;s more</h3>
<p>A new year often brings change and new opportunities and that&#8217;s definitely the case for me. Because I&#8217;m growing a new human right now and she&#8217;s due early January 2017. So once we survive Christmas, I&#8217;m starting maternity leave.</p>
<p>I will be publishing blogs here and new episodes of my <a href="http://copywritematters.com/series/hot-copy-podcast/" target="_blank">Hot Copy podcast</a>. I&#8217;ll also be mooching around on social media. So I&#8217;m not far away but my response times will be longer so if you reach out to me, I ask for your patience.</p>
<p>What else&#8230;</p>
<h3>Want to become a copywriter?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re a beginner or aspiring copywriter and you&#8217;ve been thinking about upping your writing game, my <a href="http://copywritematters.com/learn-copywriting-course/">Copywriting Master Class</a> will be open again in March 2017!</p>
<p><a title="Copywriting Master Class course outline" href="http://copywritematters.com/?download_id=f1ae7a92e99359475d759876398083ea" target="_blank">Download the course outline</a> to whet your appetite and <a href="http://copywritematters.com/learn-copywriting-course/">subscribe to get the latest news</a> (including costs and first dibs on the VIP launch price).</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s all from me&#8230; take care and be happy</h3>
<p>And thank you again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Contactdetailsblogimage.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9556 " src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Contactdetailsblogimage.png" alt="The best copywriting blog image you've ever seen!" width="477" height="511" /></a></p>
<p>You have a nice looking website outlining your copywriting services. You’ve got your Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter profiles setup and you’re curating great content from influencers. Your copywriting blog is helping to boost your search engine ranking ….</p>
<h3 class="breadcrumb">So where are all those copywriting clients?</h3>
<p><strong>If you’ve asked yourself this question, you could be committing the single biggest mistake businesses make online.</strong>I was shopping recently. The store I went to didn’t have what I was looking for so I drove on. Before I committed to driving across town I thought I’d call the next store and see if they actually had what I wanted. I whipped out my phone and went online.</p>
<p>The website wasn’t optimised for mobiles so it was hard to navigate, but that’s another blog post. I looked for their phone number on the homepage but I couldn’t see it. I looked for a contact us page and eventually found it in the page footer, in grey font on a white background.</p>
<p>That was just<em> too bloody hard </em>so I moved onto the next potential business to give me money to.</p>
<h3>Getting access to you should not be hard</h3>
<p><strong>If you are making potential clients jump through hoops before they contact you, they won’t. </strong>You might think that by making your clients click on more website pages, you have more chances to market yourself.</p>
<p>But <em>all you’re doing is pushing them to your (easy to contact) <a href="http://copywritematters.com/competition-fault/">competitors</a>.</em></p>
<p>But never fear.</p>
<h3>The fix is easy</h3>
<p><strong>1. Put your primary contact details on your website homepage and <em>make them noticeable.</em></strong></p>
<p>I recommend you choose your email address and your phone number. Even if you don&#8217;t like spending time on the phone, your copywriting clients might prefer it. And it&#8217;s all about them I&#8217;m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make your other contact details <em>easy to find.</em></strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s usually a menu item called Contact (or similar). The key is to make it easy to find and click &#8211; whether they&#8217;re on a desktop or a mobile.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make your social media icons nice and<em> visible, and clickable.</em></strong></p>
<p>This is usually about sharing your content but you can also make social media icons on some pages a way for people to get in touch with you. What ever you choose, displayed your social connectivity helps you seem more approachable. And that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>4. If you have a contact form, include other ways to contact you as well.</strong></p>
<p>Short contact forms are good but many people assume their responses go into a black hole, never to be seen again. You can overcome any reluctance to fill one out by listing other ways to get in touch. Like your phone number and email address for starters.</p>
<p>Pro tip: make your email address a graphic or spell it out like, belinda [at] copywritematters [dot] com [dot] au. This will slow down the spambots always crawling the net to find email addresses to spam.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you have a physical (postal) address, put that down too as it can help to make you seem more &#8216;real&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>5. Make sure every social media platform has your contact details so people know how to contact you <em>regardless of where they are.</em></strong></p>
<p>As soon as potential clients (or anyone for that matter) has to work too hard to find you, they won&#8217;t. So where ever you have a presence, make sure your contact details are there too.</p>
<h3>See? Easy peasy.</h3>
<p>By following these five steps you will make it easy for potential copywriting clients to transition from being interested browsers to booked clients.</p>
<p>Now this isn’t the end of the story by any means. To keep your sales pipeline full you need to court your target market by giving them a reason to stick around and get to know you. Being generous with your expertise, on your blog and social media, is great for that.</p>
<p>But<strong> if they can’t figure out how to get in contact with you, they won’t.</strong> It’s really that simple.</p>
<p>How does your online presence stack up? Does your website make it easy? What about your social media? Can your customers find your phone number where ever they are?</p>
<p>Let me know!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Creativityblogimage.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9473" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Creativityblogimage.png" alt="Creativity blog image" width="543" height="455" /></a></p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m pooped.</p>
<p>The year usually seems to race by, but right now, as we approach Christmas, time is moving like molasses. I feel like I’ve been laying tracks (figurative business tracks, that is) as fast as I can, yet I’m always getting through my to-do list just ahead of my deadlines.</p>
<p>My brain feels like Gromit in the final chase scene of Wallace and Gromit.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="//giphy.com/embed/11upydmB42l0Iw" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/11upydmB42l0Iw">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>It’s exciting. It’s invigorating. But, you can’t run an engine at full speed forever, and I keep popping my head up to see Christmas as the end of this race. I am <em>really</em> looking forward to putting my “out of office” on this year.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is that <strong>my creativity feels a little wrung out.</strong></p>
<p>I think copywriters and designers suffer from creative burnout regularly <em>as ideas are our business</em>. But, whether you’re a creative type or not, it’s important to keep the ideas factory you call your brain working at peak efficiency.</p>
<p>One of my tips to avoid creative burnout is to give myself <strong>enough time to be creative.</strong> Don’t just let your brain recover in a pool of wine and roast dinners. Give yourself this time every day.</p>
<p><strong>But, what does that really mean?</strong></p>
<p><em>The Artist’s Way</em> is a book by Julia Cameron. A lot of people know this book because the process of unleashing your creative self isn’t just for artists. Almost every successful person I know (or aspire to know) has read this book and put some of its practises into place.</p>
<h3>Write morning pages</h3>
<p>Start each day with unstructured writing time. Don’t write a book or a blog. Just set a timer and write whatever pops into your head—without stopping.</p>
<p>I find this process <strong>incredibly efficient at decluttering my brain.</strong></p>
<p>I have a terrible habit of looking at my phone when I wake up, which usually means I jolt my brain awake with social media posts to read or respond to and emails I received overnight. That’s not great for meditation (my other morning ritual).</p>
<p>Writing my morning pages helps me to clear the slate of what is essentially brain clutter.</p>
<p>Now, morning pages and meditation might seem a bit too Zen for you, but if you really want to give your brain the space it needs to be creative, then find your own way to clear the slate of low-priority or non-urgent things that are screaming for your attention but don’t actually need it.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="//giphy.com/embed/DB2oahQFa0qeQ" width="480" height="269" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/finding-nemo-roman-reigns-dean-ambrose-DB2oahQFa0qeQ">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Maybe it’s a run with music. Maybe it’s an email widget that doesn’t deliver emails until you begin work. Whatever is it, stop the chatter that’s constantly invading your creative space.</p>
<h3>Schedule creative project time</h3>
<p>The next part of the time equation is making sure your copywriting project timeline supports creative thinking.</p>
<p>You need time to put yourself in your clients’ shoes, mull over their frustrations and their challenges and consider potential solutions from different angles. While you have to put a cap on your brainstorming time, your copywriting project schedule does need to factor it in if you don’t want to take disastrous shortcuts.</p>
<p>Or more commonly, <strong>write bland and uninteresting copy</strong> because you don’t have time to do better.</p>
<h3>Make creative life time</h3>
<p>An extension of giving your brain the space to actually be creative is <strong>making sure your life supports creative thinking.</strong></p>
<p>Sounds important, doesn’t it? However, it’s like one of those “spend more quality time with your kids” things—important but easily squished in the priority list as you keep laying the next bit of track down.</p>
<p>One way I’ve made this kind of time is to <strong>prioritise creative activities.</strong></p>
<p>Once a month, I set off with no specific agenda in mind. I go to the museum. I head to an art gallery. I mooch through laneways looking at people and graffiti. I don’t go out to source blog ideas, fill my Instagram thread or look creative.</p>
<p>After using morning pages and meditation to regularly create some quiet brain space, <strong>I want to expose my mind to other ideas.</strong></p>
<p>There will <em>always</em> be more emails. There will <em>always</em> be a hot new marketing strategy you can implement. There will <em>always</em> be <a href="http://copywritematters.com/series/hot-copy-podcast/" target="_blank">podcasts</a> to listen to and blog posts to read (or create). These are just part of being a freelance copywriter and business owner.</p>
<p>But giving your brain new information and ideas <strong>also gives it more inputs to connect in quiet moments.</strong> Those unforced connections help you flex and strengthen your creative muscles.</p>
<h3>The results are cumulative</h3>
<p>By making regular time in your life to be creative, you’re more likely to slip into the smoking jacket of creativity more easily. It’s fun, too.</p>
<p>I know the results are cumulative because this process also works the other way. When you stop making time to let you brain recover from constant copywriting and run wild creatively (without structure) now and then, you begin to feel like you’re running out of track.</p>
<p>That’s where I am right now—almost out of track but looking forward to restocking over Christmas and rebooting my good habits.</p>
<h3>So how much time are we talking?</h3>
<p>Decluttering time, creative project time, life time…when you’re already busy (and aren’t we all), it can feel like there is <em>no more time</em> to spare.</p>
<p>So, let’s break it down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>A daily brain declutter: 15–30 minutes</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This is the time it might take you to have a cuppa. Just one cuppa a day to leave your brain fresh and uncluttered. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Project time: 1–2 hours for creative thinking on each copywriting project</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Whether you sit down and work through a creative process or you just want to leave enough time to think in the shower, scheduling this time into your plan will mark your thinking time as valuable.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Life time: Half a day, once a month</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you have no-work </em><em>weekends, fantastic (I do recommend them), but make time to do something that fills your creative well with new input. Four hours in 30 days? You can do that! </em></p>
<p>When you lay it out, that’s not a lot of time. At all.</p>
<p>Consider this post the kick up the bum we both need to value creative time.</p>
<p>It’s good for your brain, and it’s good for business. Creativity isn’t just about creating art. It can involve creative problem solving, creative strategies and of course creative writing.</p>
<p>So, how about you? How much time do you make to feed your creativity? Do you think it’s important? Or, is it a load of nonsense that successful business people don’t have time for?</p>
<p>I’d love to know your thoughts.</p>

<p>Email marketing has been the popular guest at the online marketing party for a long time now. Regardless of what people say, <strong>email is definitely NOT dead</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s hard to write great emails that cut through the clutter of our inboxes, but at the 2016 Digital Commerce Summit, Brian Clark shared some stats indicating that using email is a constant part of our lives, and millennials are no different. <a href="http://marketingland.com/speak-millennial-use-email-124811">This 2015 post from Marketing Land</a> says the same thing: young people are using email just as much as the rest of us.</p>
<p>So, when you want to reach out to people in a way that feels intimate and gets responses, <strong>write awesome emails</strong>.</p>
<p>But, once you write that email to a prospective copywriting client and actually hit send…then what?</p>
<p>You need to follow up, right? But how?</p>
<p>How you follow up on your email marketing can determine whether you get the business or the cold shoulder (or worse, the spam and block).</p>
<p>This post outlines some considerations and strategies for when you’re planning how to follow up on your email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><span id="more-9427"></span></p>
<h3>Email marketing follow-up strategies</h3>
<p>Before you start stepping your reader through the ins and outs of your services, you must make sure you’re talking to the right person.</p>
<p>After all, your email campaign could be targeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>the wrong audience altogether.</li>
<li>the right audience but the wrong person.</li>
<li>the right audience and person but at the wrong time.</li>
<li>the right audience and person at the right time. SCORE!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go through each of these scenarios and some lines you can use to quanlify your audience as part of your follow-up strategy.</p>
<p>Before we jump in,<strong> this process assumes that <a href="http://copywritematters.com/email-marketing-case-study/">you have written an awesome email</a> that identifies the challenges your readers are facing and gives them a good reason to talk to you.</strong></p>
<h3>The wrong email audience</h3>
<p>I recently got an email about some IT services. My name wasn’t used in the greeting (SPAM flag #1), it opened with the line “You create SEO strategies for your clients.” (I don’t; SPAM flag #2), the spelling and grammar weren’t great (SPAM flag #3) and it was full of technical jargon that I didn’t understand (overall FAIL).</p>
<p>I got three follow-up emails from this person before I replied explaining that I was clearly not the client he was looking for and asking him to take me off his list. This sender was <em>genuinely surprised</em>. He was not a deliberate spammer, but he was clearly targeting the wrong person, making his emails a wasted effort and an annoyance to me.</p>
<p>I suspect most people would have just marked his email as spam and blocked him as a sender. That result is a lot worse for your business than an ignored email!</p>
<h4>Email follow-up strategy</h4>
<p>When you email your prospective clients, ask them the following questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Is this a challenge you’re facing right now?”</em></p>
<p>Or even</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Is this something you’d be interested in chatting about some more?”</em></p>
<p>Consider including this line:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If not, just hit reply and let me know, and I’ll be sure not to bother you again.”</em></p>
<p>This will help you ascertain if you are targeting the right audience and help your audience feel empowered enough to stop you before you annoy them. And, it’s all very friendly and polite.</p>
<h3>The right email audience but the wrong person</h3>
<p>If you’re targeting someone within a corporation, it’s not only possible but likely that you won’t get the right person on your first email. It all depends on how well <a href="http://copywritematters.com/define-target-market/">you researched your target reader</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the right person to talk to is essentia</strong>l when you’re promoting your services, as the wrong person won’t know about the challenges being faced and won’t care about your solution.</p>
<h4>Email follow-up strategy</h4>
<p>In your follow-up email, ask “Are you the best person to discuss this with? If not, could you perhaps let me know who is?”</p>
<p>Simple and to the point.</p>
<h3>The right email audience and person at the wrong time</h3>
<p>With any luck, you’ve done your research before emailing someone about your services. You’ve pegged him or her as being in your ideal customer audience, you’ve got the right person and you’ve greeted him or her by name.</p>
<p>GO YOU! #marketinghighfives</p>
<p><strong>But, he or she may not be ready to talk to you. </strong></p>
<p>He or she may be busy or may need to build a stronger relationship with you before being ready to commit.</p>
<p><em>Remember that hiring a copywriter (like you) to write the words that present a business to potential customers is a big deal. It requires trust, and building trust can take time.</em></p>
<h4>Email follow-up strategy</h4>
<p>After ascertaining your recipient is the right person, offer to chat with him or her about specific challenges and how you can help. But, leave an easy way to put you off for a while:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If I’ve caught you at a bad time, just let me know, and I’ll check back in a month’s time.”</em></p>
<p>Or get to know you a little more first:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If improving the way you talk about your business (your copywriting) is on your radar, you might like to read some free copywriting tips on my blog. I also have this helpful page with tips on how to get the most out of working with a copywriter like myself.”</em></p>
<p>And when you follow up in a month’s time, you can say,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I’m looking at my project calendar for the next month, and it’s filling up pretty fast. As we’ve been chatting about your copywriting needs, I want to make sure you are a priority booking.”</em></p>
<p>This works well when you’ve already sent <a href="http://copywritematters.com/copywriting-proposal-explosion/">a copywriting proposal</a>, but it can also work to give people a little nudge to have that first chat with you.</p>
<h3>The right email audience and person at the right time</h3>
<p>When this happens, you’ve struck GOLD! It’s time to take action!</p>
<p>That action might be sending a proposal (which requires its own follow-up strategy!) or sending a deposit and getting a <a href="http://copywritematters.com/the-secret-to-mindblowing-copywriting/">copywriting brief</a>!</p>
<p>Whichever it is, don’t dilly-dally!  If your awesome email marketing has worked and your potential client is ready to become a client, you cannot let them go cold on you.</p>
<h3>The point of it all</h3>
<p>Effective email marketing campaigns are <strong>well-researched</strong>, <strong>well-targeted</strong> and <strong>well-written</strong>. But, one email is rarely enough to encourage meaningful action.</p>
<p>An email follow-up strategy is essential, and it doesn’t have to feel like a hustle.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be polite.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Show understanding.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Be willing to give your reader the space he or she needs to say yes.</p>
<p>I hope these tips have been useful. Let me know if they have been. Or, perhaps you have your own follow-up ninja tricks. If you do, share them here!</p>

<p>This week we&#8217;re stepping back in time to revisit one of our all time favourite pods &#8211; and by the look of the stats one of your faves too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all very good and well to understand how to use modal verbs and where to place your colons, but seriously the hard fact is that no copywriting business will survive without CLIENTS!!</p>
<p>Sadly too many copywriting businesses fail in their first year because they simply can’t find enough clients.</p>
<p>Friends and family are a great place to start, but where on earth do you track down awesome potential clients with money to spend?</p>

<p>What if you could sit down face to face with Neil Patel, Danny Iny, Bushra Azhar, Tom Morkes, Navid Moazzez, Liam Austin, Stephen Esketzis, Jon Schumacher and other world-class experts?</p>
<p>Including me!</p>
<p>Imagine how many valuable insights you could get from just 15 minutes…</p>
<h4>What if I could give you more than 15 minutes and for FREE?</h4>
<p>What if? What if? What if?</p>
<p>Well, I was recently invited to participate in a rather amazing online summit all about launching online products, <em>successfully</em>. The 10 day summit has 30 experts in their fields share the latest strategies on finding great partners, create your winning strategy and position yourself for launch success.</p>
<p>This is not just another virtual summit with a lot of interviews on unrelated topics that you should somehow put together and implement on your own.</p>
<p>Instead, <strong>this is a carefully curated 10-day crash course on launching your product online, even if your email list is tiny (or non-existent).</strong></p>
<p>Since I’m a speaker I’ve lined up a FREE ticket for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://brainartllc.simplero.com/products/51665-Premium-Pass-Launch-With-Partners?ref=8644-Belinda-Weaver">Grab your FREE PASS here</a></p>
<p><strong>My presentation shares my tips on writing copy that sells your product <em>before</em> you launch (so you sell out when you launch).</strong></p>
<p>I walk through my strategy for creating buzz around my sell-out <a href="http://copywritematters.com/learn-copywriting-course/">Copywriting Master Class</a>. Which hasn&#8217;t just sold out once. It&#8217;s sold out <em>five times</em>. As I&#8217;ve only run the course six times, I think that&#8217;s a good result.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m just one speaker out of thirty.</p>
<p><a href="https://brainartllc.simplero.com/products/51665-Premium-Pass-Launch-With-Partners?ref=8644-Belinda-Weaver" target="_blank">Click here to grab your FREE Pass before it all starts</a>.</p>
<p>Over these 10 days in October you can also</p>
<p>&#8230;listen to Danny Iny do a deep-dive into how he started with a handful of potential partners and building up to a business that brings in multiple millions in annual revenue&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and Neil Patel explain how he got his book deal worth $500,000 upfront&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and learn from Rich German as he explains the magic question which could bring you more and more partners to help you with your launch&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>You have 48 hours to to view each session for FREE.<br />
</strong>Or <a href="http://smpl.ro/al/NfmPPMhHN4UVKwsqYVyJepSA/8644-Belinda-Weaver" target="_blank">upgrade to a premium pass</a> and keep all the sessions plus get tonnes of extra bonuses.</p>
<p>After you attend Launch with Partners Crash Course you’ll know how to find great partners, create your winning strategy and position yourself for launch success.</p>
<h3>When does it start?</h3>
<p><strong>October 17</strong> is Day 0, when Launch with Partners 10-Day Crash Course kicks off.</p>
<p>It all wraps up on October 28.</p>
<p>30 speakers giving your over 20 hours of high quality expertise, worth well over $10,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://brainartllc.simplero.com/products/51665-Premium-Pass-Launch-With-Partners?ref=8644-Belinda-Weaver" target="_blank">Find out more about the speakers and the summit program And grab your FREE Pass before it all starts</a>.</p>
<h3>Fancy a free launch playbook to whet your whistle?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re not quite ready to sign up for a free pass, Ciprian has created a <b>Launch with Partners Playbook.</b> The Playbook isn’t just a guide to the crash course; it’s also a cheat sheet for what YOU can do to skyrocket your product launch right away.</p>
<p><a href="http://smpl.ro/al/xMexgAReMKhAiqbvNDCTAN4N/8644-Belinda-Weaver" target="_blank">Grab the free playbook </a></p>
<p>So. Much. Free.</p>
<p>I will definitely be tuning into the other sessions!</p>
