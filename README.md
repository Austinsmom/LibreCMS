### Setup:
LibreCMS uses PHP's PDO for Database integration. So all you need to do, is use a Database Engine that's compatible with PDO. Then import the "libre.sql" file found in the "includes/" folder, then edit the "config.ini" file in the "includes/" folder.
Remember to set the appropriate file and folder permissions for security purposes, and make sure "media" uses 0755 so files can be uploaded when editing or creating content.

### NOTE:
* This is currently a work in progress, and being converted to an MVC System. If you download and use LibreCMS in a Production Environment, you do so at your own risk.
* We openly welcome help with MVC Conversion, and bug squashing.
