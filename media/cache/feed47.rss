<p>This week we&#8217;re revisiting one of our most popular pods: the one about copywriting fees and how much to charge.</p>
<p>Why is this topic so popular? Until you have a few copywriting projects under your belt it can feel like you&#8217;re just making up numbers in your quotes. Not many copywriters share their rates so it&#8217;s hard to see what the industry standard is.</p>
<p>Not us though. In this podcast we explain how we charge for copywriting, how we put together quotes, essentials tips on collecting deposits and why we’re not big fans of charging by the word.</p>
<p><strong>Tune in to learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to work out your hourly rate</li>
<li>Different ways to charge for your copywriting work</li>
<li>How to use retainer agreements</li>
<li>Our quoting formula</li>
<li>Why getting a deposit is so important</li>
<li>How to chase up later payers</li>
</ul>
<p>Find us on:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Formattingblogimage.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9012" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Formattingblogimage.png" alt="Formatting blog image - display images to see it! " width="483" height="483" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I love reading great copy but there is something a little intimidating about a long page of copywriting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I get the same feeling when someone places a huge plate of food in front of me. I feel exhausted (and full) just looking at it!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A long page of copy can be a real turn off because <strong>we don’t read nowadays; we skim</strong>. We scan the page looking for signals that this copy has the answer we seek, the scratch to our itch or just some good old fashion entertainment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Whatever we&#8217;re looking for, we rarely sit down and read online content word for word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>So how do you make them stay, and listen to all you say. How do you keep the waves upon the saaaaaand.</em> Woah. Sorry. I went all Sound of Music there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But seriously. How you hook scrollers in to read more of your message?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You break it up into digestible chunks and make it nice to look to at. Just like a toddlers dinner. When you apply the techniques I cover in this post, the skimmers will still know what you’re talking about and be persuaded to dig a little deeper.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I’m going to show you how to break up your long copy, transforming a text-heavy landscape into a delight to the eyes.</strong> Not to mention an irresistible attraction to read more.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Here we go&#8230;</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are some tried and tested copywriting methods to break up long copy. They aren’t complicated or tricky to pull off but you must exercise some restraint otherwise your marketing copywriting will look like that time you left the house wearing every accessory you own.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Not a good look.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Subheadings tell your mini-story</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Good subheadings catch the eye and hint at the value of the copywriting that follows. But they can do more than that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A subheading helps to break content up: </strong>a great way to elbow some white space onto the page</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A subheading helps the transition:</strong> helps readers follow your train of thought and transition to the next point you’re making.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A subheading creates a road map:</strong> allow the readers who simply scan your copy to get a feel for the entire piece. To test your subheadings, skim your copy <em>only reading the subheadings</em>. Do you know what your article/letter/blog/brochure is about?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Think of subheadings as <strong>doors opening up to rooms of text</strong>: you want them to be easy to unlock or else the reader will stop trying to open them.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Avoid puns and cryptic words.</li>
<li>Use consistent grammatical structures (like starting with verbs or asking questions).</li>
<li>Don’t make them too long. Focus on short and powerful.</li>
<li>Link them to your topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Lists. So easy to skim.</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enough said really! That awesome little list of tips above, made so much more readable using a bullet list!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I like to keep my lists to 5 items or fewer as long lists are just as overwhelming as long paragraphs! <em>If you find yourself with longer lists, consider other ways of formatting – or keep each point very brief.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>White space for some visual breathing room</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Long copy is already bombarding your reader so it’s important to provide some room between headings, words, paragraphs and images.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Separate ideas into different paragraphs and make sure there is space between them. Add space after headlines and subheadings and don&#8217;t be afraid to have a one line sentence proudly standing, surrounded my space.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">White space is your friend!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Use formatting to pick out your shiny points</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I love a good sprinkling of <strong>bold,</strong> <em>italics </em>and varying sizes through copy. It can really help make phrases stand out and I use them to indicate, “<em>if nothing else is read, this must be read</em>”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But you don’t want your copy to look like Las Vegas so show some restraint. After all, overuse will just lead to irrelevance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can also show use your punctuation to add some visual pizzazz. That&#8217;s right. I said pizzazz.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Use 1, 2, 3 instead of one, two, three. N<em>ot necessarily grammatically correct, but great in headlines.</em></li>
<li>Use added periods for emphasis of a key phrase, especially at the end of a line: These. Must. Be. Used. Sparingly.</li>
<li>Separate a string of thoughts&#8230; with ellipses that&#8230; give the eye a break.</li>
<li>Use brackets (even when something’s not a side note).</li>
<li>Trading in periods and commas for long, noticeable lines—called em dashes—can give a statement a bit more drama—and make it stand out.</li>
<li>Replace “and” with an ampersand (i.e. “&amp;”) or a plus sign (i.e. “+”).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now you may have to fight with your proofreader on some on these but they will give your readers&#8217; eyes a bit of a break and make long copy a little more interesting to read.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ditch the justified text</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sure it looks neat when it all lines up nicely on the right hand side but it actually makes your copywriting harder to read.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Allow different sized paragraphs and sentences of varying lengths to add some ebb and flow to your copywriting.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Note: <strong>Justifying your copy is different to aligning your copy.</strong> When you justify your copy, you&#8217;ll get a big square shape of words. Left align your copy for a more shapely and readable view.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Add visual variety</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">My last tip is to spice things up visually with things like testimonials whizzied up as images, call to actions or images that connect with your messages.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These are essential techniques when you&#8217;re writing landing page that tend to be loooooong. They are long because there is usually a lot of story to tell but that&#8217;s when presentation of the copy becomes critical.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And now it’s over to you…. Do you like reading <a title="Long Copy vs Short Copy. How much copywriting do you need?" href="http://www.copywritematters.com.au/long-copy-short-copy-copywriting/">long copy or short copy</a>? Have you got any other tricks that help make the long read a pleasure?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest post by the knowledgeable and crazy-talented Cathy Topping at Two10 Solutions.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CathyCanvatemplateblogpostgraphic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8926" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CathyCanvatemplateblogpostgraphic.jpg" alt="Display images to see this Canva template blog post graphic" width="585" height="484" /></a></p>
<p>Have you ever sat down and worked out how much time you spend creating your social media graphics every month?</p>
<p>Obviously that figure will very much depend on how many platforms you use, and how often you create new content to share.</p>
<p>I’m willing to bet, however, that you spend way more time on this that you need to.</p>
<p>Creating your social media graphics is an inescapable reality of running an online business. But it doesn’t have to be a time consuming black hole that eats into your productivity every month.</p>
<p>Get some systems and templates in place, and you’ll be able to create all of your social media graphics in under 2 hours a month.</p>
<p>And a bonus? They’ll be consistently on-brand.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to do:</p>
<h3>1.  Create a brand style guide</h3>
<p>If you don’t have one of these already, <strong>you should spend the time setting it up.</strong> It doesn’t have to be fancy or complicated, but its purpose is to help you decide (and then keep to!) your key design decisions.</p>
<p>A brand style guide should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your logo</li>
<li>Primary &amp; secondary colours</li>
<li>Primary &amp; secondary font choices</li>
<li>Photography /imagery examples</li>
</ul>
<p>If you spend some time initially creating this 1 page reference, it will help you stop changing your mind and experimenting, every time you make a graphic. The truth is we’re all guilty of this, but to get efficient you need to stop!</p>
<p><em>(A word from The Copy Detective: When I started creating more graphical elements of my marketing, I didn&#8217;t have a plan or a style guide. Cathy helpfully pointed out that I was diluting my branding with all my different looks. If you want someone to see an image and know that it&#8217;s from your business, this is a must. Sorry Cathy, back to you!)</em></p>
<p>Here’s an example of a style guide I use for my business:</p>
<figure id="attachment_8914" style="width: 403px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-8914" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates1.jpg" alt="Cathy Topping guest blog - image brand style guide" width="403" height="583" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Example: Style guide for Two10 Solutions</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can create something like this within a program like PowerPoint, or an online tool like Canva.</p>
<h3>2. Use Canva to create templates</h3>
<p>You’ve got your style guide created, so now you need to set up some templates.</p>
<p><strong>Templates are the key to managing your time productively</strong>, and <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a> have got your back with this one.</p>
<p>While setting the templates up, allow yourself the time to experiment with different layouts. Work out what fits your brand, including any existing visual marketing that you use.</p>
<p>And don’t forget, you’ve already set up your brand guidelines, so stick to your decisions around colours and fonts.</p>
<p>You can create a few different templates, so that your social media visuals aren’t always really similar.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, it takes time to set up the initial templates, but once they’re done, it’s a breeze to create individual graphics.</strong></p>
<h3>3. How to create templates</h3>
<p>For this post, I’m going to run through setting up a template for a blog post image.</p>
<p>The logic applies across all your social media platforms, so set each one up, and you’ll have everything ready to go at a moment’s notice.</p>
<h4><strong>Pick the relevant layout</strong></h4>
<p>Canva offer lots of templates you can use as a starting point. They are set up with the correct dimensions for each social media platform, so you just pick one and get designing.</p>

<p>For your blog header, select the “Blog Title” for your page layout.</p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8916" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates3.jpg" alt="Cathy canva templates 3" width="940" height="265" /></a></p>
<p>Canva offers a selection of design ideas to use as a starting point. You can pick one of these, or start with a blank page and dive in.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8917" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates4.jpg" alt="Cathy canva templates 4" width="355" height="575" /></a></strong></p>
<h4><strong>Design 1 or 2 layouts to use as a template</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Spend this time really thinking about how you want your imagery to represent your brand</li>
<li>Create 1 or 2 designs that you can use and tweak, over and over</li>
<li>Use Canva’s inbuilt photography or upload your own photographs from other sources</li>
<li>Keep referring to your brand guidelines</li>
<li><strong>Create 1 template for each design, on each platform</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>For each new blog post, create your header image</strong></h4>
<p>Here’s where it gets really clever!</p>
<p>Canva allows you to add new pages below the one that you’re working on.</p>
<p>Each template becomes a reference file of all your images. You can quickly copy the previous page, update the image and content, and you’re done!<br />
<a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8918" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates5-1024x587.jpg" alt="Cathy canva templates 5" width="1024" height="587" /></a></p>
<p>Each time you need a new image for a blog post, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the page</li>
<li>Update the images(s), change your text, and rejig slightly to make it fit the new content</li>
<li>Export the new image as a JPG</li>
<li>You can select which page you want to export, so pick the new one that you’ve created.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8919" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cathycanvatemplates6.jpg" alt="Cathy canva templates 6" width="258" height="395" /></a></p>
<h3>4. How long will this take?</h3>
<p>Setting up your brand guidelines and templates is going to involve an initial time investment from you.</p>
<p>If you’ve already been creating social media graphics for your blog, you can just refine what you’ve already done to make it more consistent.</p>
<p>If you’re starting from scratch, it may take a little longer initially, but in the long run, <em>you will save loads of time.</em></p>
<p><strong>But this is not just about time. It’s about brand consistency.</strong></p>
<p>This approach will keep you focused and consistent, and with your brand a consistent look is really important.</p>
<p>So…let’s break it down!</p>
<h4><strong>How many templates will you need?</strong></h4>
<p>This will vary from business to business, and you’ll also find that some social media platforms are better at pulling your images from your website than others.</p>
<p>Examples of templates you might set up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A blog header</strong> &#8211; this will usually pull across to your Facebook page, Twitter account and Google+ without too much hassle</li>
<li><strong>A Facebook image template</strong> – if you’re doing things like posting quote images, or creating other graphics to post directly into Facebook, it’s a good idea to set up a template for this, as the dimensions are different</li>
<li><strong>A Pinterest template</strong> – the dimensions for Pinterest are specific, so create this as its own template.</li>
<li><strong>An Instagram image</strong> – by creating a template with the correct dimensions, you don’t risk the vital information in your image being cropped off</li>
<li><strong>Call to action (CTA)</strong> – You could create a template for a visual CTA for the bottom of each blog post</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>How long will this take?</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Initial setup</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Brand guidelines: 30 minutes</li>
<li>Each social media template: 15-30 minutes</li>
<li>In the example I’ve given, there are 5 templates to set up, so about 1.25 – 2.5 hours</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total time: between 2-3 hours</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Ongoing time commitment</strong></h4>
<p>With the templates in place, <strong>it should only take you less than 5 minutes to create each graphic.</strong></p>
<p>So, if you have 5 graphics to create for each blog post, that’s 25 minutes</p>
<p><strong>If you write 4 blog posts a month, that comes to under 2 hours a month. To create all your social media graphics for each blog post you write.</strong></p>
<h4>Here’s another way to look at it.</h4>
<p>Once you have everything set up, <strong>it will take you less than 5 minutes to create an image to use on social media.</strong></p>
<p>Now, what are you going to do with all that time you’ve saved?<strong>  </strong></p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how professional copywriters make writing look <em>so easy?</em> I can tell you that copywriting isn’t easy but when you know the techniques and processes behind writing compelling, profitable copy, it’s a lot less painful.</p>
<p>This week I opened the doors of my <a href="http://copywritematters.com/learn-copywriting-course/" target="_blank">Copywriting Master Class</a> to accept new students. People who are ready to take the first step to include compelling, profitable copywriting as something they rock.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to know anything about copywriting or marketing</strong> because everything you need to know is explained across 16 lessons delivered over 12 weeks … If you already know a thing or two, <em>you&#8217;ll accelerate those skills</em>.</p>
<p><a class="button" href="http://copywritematters.com/?download_id=f1ae7a92e99359475d759876398083ea">Read the detailed course outline</a></p>
<h3>You can save 10% on the price of this online copywriting course&#8230; but not for long.</h3>
<p>I know there are cheaper courses. There are shorter courses.</p>
<p><strong>This is a copywriting course for people who are serious about making an investment … in themselves.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Is that you?</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been looking around at copywriting courses you will have asked yourself, how can I tell which course is best for <em>me</em>?</p>
<p>This post digs into <strong>what makes <em>this</em> copywriting course so good. </strong></p>
<h3>The personal coaching element is by far and away the BEST part of this course.</h3>
<p>You cannot learn to write profitable copy in a vacuum (unless you’re prepared to spend years gaining experience).</p>
<p>You need to apply the skills and techniques, then you need feedback on where you’re falling short and how to take the extra steps to greatness.</p>
<p>That’s what the coaching element of this copywriting course offers. <strong>You get me as your copywriting coach</strong>, nurturing your skills and helping you to improve much faster than you could on your own.</p>
<p>That’s why I (seriously) limit each intake. Once the copywriting course is booked, the doors close.</p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Janistestimonial.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8191 size-large" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Janistestimonial-1024x576.jpg" alt="Janis testimonial for copywriting course" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Next…</strong></p>
<h3>You get LIFETIME ACCESS to the course content, including access to ALL FUTURE UPGRADES.</h3>
<p>Now that’s a big deal as I update the course content for each release of the course. I add resources, check lists, explanations and examples. As new stories and case studies become available, they get added as well. <strong>And you have access it to all.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Melissatestimonial.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6905" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Melissatestimonial-1024x576.jpg" alt="Melissa testimonial about copywriting course" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Next… </strong></h3>
<h3>There are NO DEADLINES to get feedback from me.</h3>
<p>Other copywriting courses make you keep up with the lessons being sent and limit how long you have to get reviews and feedback. I don’t like courses like that so the Copywriting Master Class isn’t one.</p>
<p>The upshot is that your experience as a student is the same whether you start on day 1 or day 100, whether you do each lesson as it comes in or you have to take a break now and then.</p>
<p>For as long as the course is running, I am there for you.<strong> I am committed to helping you succeed as a copywriter.</strong></p>
<p>It’s up to YOU how you take full advantage of the opportunities the Copywriting Master Class offers you.</p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Derektestimonial2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6830" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Derektestimonial2-1024x576.jpg" alt="Testimonial from new copywriter, Derek" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<h3>The VIP launch price ends SOON</h3>
<p>Seats were grabbed with the first few hours and those new copywriter are already digging in. Registrations are open until August 30 OR until the course is full. Which ever happens first.</p>
<p><em>I only accept a limited number of students in each course so it pays not to dilly dally too much.</em></p>
<p>And when you can save nearly $200 but registering now, well, that&#8217;s serious food for thought.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re still a bit iffy about whether or not it&#8217;s the right course for you, why not <a title="Contact" href="http://copywritematters.com/contact/">drop me a line</a> with your concerns and we can chat about them.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of waiting until the last day, don&#8217;t. That day might come sooner than you think!</p>
<p><a class="button" href="http://copywritematters.com/learn-copywriting-course/" target="_blank">Secure your seat now</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you hadn’t noticed, the marketing chitchat is all about Facebook ads right now. As I spend a lot of time on Facebook, I also see a lot of ads, and you know what? I don’t mind them!</p>
<p>I like seeing targeted offers that I wouldn’t see otherwise. I like finding interesting companies that I wouldn’t find otherwise.</p>
<p>One such company is thredUP. They sell second-hand clothes online.</p>
<p>I don’t have leisure time to shop anymore. I do most clothes shopping online, and being able to reconcile my love of op-shopping (or thrift store shopping for my American friends) with my inability to spend much time in clothes shops is a WIN for me!</p>
<p>I saw thredUP’s ad on Facebook and clicked it faster than my daughter runs when she hears the cracker jar being opened (fast).</p>
<p>And here is when things got tricky.</p>
<p>This is thredUP’s homepage:</p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ThredUp1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8498" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ThredUp1-1024x572.png" alt="thredUP homepage" width="1024" height="572" /></a></p>
<p>Behind the pop-up, you can see hints of their stock.</p>
<p>Sometimes websites present you with pop-ups on arrival. They’re called landing or welcome mats. They might present you with an offer, give you some tips on improving your experience on the website, or ask you to sign up for something.</p>
<p>Like many people, <strong>I don’t like marketing in my face when I’ve just arrived.</strong></p>
<p>When I walk into a bricks-and-mortar shop, I like a hello from the sales assistant. I like to know they’re available. But I don’t like them asking me what I’m after and how they can help before I’ve taken three steps into the store. I’m a cranky pants like that.</p>
<p>The same applies to websites. Sure, <strong>offer to help me, but don’t engage me any more than that until I’ve had a chance to get my bearings.</strong></p>
<p>Assuming this was one such pop-up, I looked for a way to close it. I didn’t see an X or a CLOSE link, so I clicked behind the pop-up to send it on its way.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I clicked every square inch of that screen before I realised that sucker wasn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>If we take a look at the actual pop-up, we see that it asks me to create an account:</p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ThredUp3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8499 " src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ThredUp3-1024x665.png" alt="ThredUp 3" width="602" height="391" /></a></p>
<p>Sure, I <em>only</em> need to enter my email address, but as part of the process, I have to agree to receive all their marketing guff.</p>
<p>I could not progress onto the site unless I created an account.</p>
<p><strong>It’s free to join, they say, but it’s not free.</strong> My inbox is paying before I’ve even looked at the stock.</p>
<p>Going back to the bricks and mortar example, this is like the salesperson refusing to let me into the store unless I get their store card. Would you go in?</p>
<p>So I rant on Facebook. Then I create an account. Because I’m interested in second-hand clothes.</p>
<p>My annoyance at having to create an account was <em>lower</em> than my interest in second-hand clothes, but as I scrolled through the clothes, cancelling and unsubscribing were pretty high on my things-to-do-next list.</p>
<p>Now some of you might be thinking, “You created an account, so it worked!”</p>
<p>Yes, I created an account.</p>
<p>Yes, the analysis of conversions registered another sign-up, and if they’re smart, that’s also linked back to their Facebook ad.</p>
<p><strong>Hooray for in-your-face popups…they WORK!</strong></p>
<p>But here I am, more than a week later, the bad taste still lingering so much that I’m ranting about it on my blog. That marketing is <em>not</em> working.</p>
<p><em>A quick aside: My issue isn’t with pop-ups. I actually like well-written, well-timed pop-ups on websites. But I don’t like pop-ups that get in my face before I’ve even had a chance to look around.</em></p>
<h2>Some goodwill clawed back</h2>
<p>The story takes another turn when I receive an email from James Reinhart, the co-founder of thredUP.</p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ThredUp2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8500" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ThredUp2-1024x642.png" alt="thredUP email 1" width="1024" height="642" /></a></p>
<p>Kudos for the follow-up.</p>
<p>Kudos for the offer.</p>
<p>Kudos for inviting feedback and for making the email feel like it came from a real person.</p>
<p>So I replied.</p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ThredUp4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8501" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ThredUp4-1024x388.png" alt="thredUP email 2" width="1024" height="388" /></a></p>
<p><strong>This story is ongoing. </strong></p>
<p>I’ll keep you posted on any replies I get. And I do expect one. After all, Mr James said he replies to <em>every</em> email.</p>
<h2>So what’s the lesson here?</h2>
<p>First, if you have a blog, you can rant about stuff like this.</p>
<p>But more importantly, this is about putting yourself in your website visitors’ virtual shoes even it’s just for a second or two.</p>
<p>Do you care more about your subscriber and conversion numbers than you do about the experience real people are having?</p>
<p>Website visitors are worth way more than their email addresses, so consider how you can build trust <em>and</em> get the opportunity to sell to them.</p>
<p>Answer that and then implement it.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear what you come up with.</p>

<p>When you’re writing marketing collateral, from website copy to printed brochures, it’s pretty normal to start with what you know.</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>But if you’re not careful, you’ll end up sounding like a one of those annoying dinner party guests that just won’t shut up about themselves. It’s all me me me ….. <em>Enough about me. What do you think about me?</em></p>
<p>You know the type!</p>
<p>If you want to write copy that <em>really connects</em> with people, so much so that they actually keep reading, you need to make them part of the story.</p>
<p>This post covers five no fail ways you can transform your copywriting from a mega phone blast to your market to an intimate chat with your customers.</p>
<h2>1. Walk a mile (or 2) in your customers’ shoes</h2>
<p>Be as literal as you need to be to face the same challenges and work out what it is your customers really care about. Don’t assume you know and just pad your copywriting out with <a href="http://copywritematters.com/why-10-dollar-words-make-your-copywriting-suck/">buzzwords</a> that sound good.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://copywritematters.com/define-target-market/">23 answers you need to define your target market.</a></p>
<p>If you’re a copywriter writing to someone else’s target market, this list will still help you to get into their headspace. The most important part of understanding your reader is to think about the why behind their actions – <a href="http://copywritematters.com/copywriting-audience-motive-lenses/">their motives</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Talk about benefits not features</h2>
<p>You’ve probably heard this before but it can be harder than you think.  A little copywriting trick I use is to imagine a stony faced customer responding to my explanation with a “so what?” … again and again and again.</p>
<p>I say:  My copywriting has a very conversational tone to it</p>
<p><em>So what?</em> Well that means that your marketing will feel more approachable</p>
<p><em>So what?</em> Your target market will be more engaged with your key message</p>
<p><em>So what?</em> More people will be persuaded to hand over their cash</p>
<p><em>So what?</em> You sell more stuff and make more profit!</p>
<p>Ahhhhh … now you’re talking</p>
<p>That means that you don’t tell your customers about your widget, you talk about how your widget will make their life easier/happier/quicker/more comfortable/safer.</p>
<p>If you’d like to see this copywriting technique in more detail, <a href="http://copywritematters.com/register-free-copywriting-course/">sign up for my free copywriting mini-course</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Make it personal</h2>
<p>Switching most of the instances of “We” for a “You” will immediately change the focus from the business company to the customer.</p>
<p>In fact, a good rule of thumb is to <strong>try and use the word “you” twice as much as the words “me” and “I” or “we” and “us”.</strong></p>
<p>So rather than “We provide at home consultations for your convenience” you could say “To fit in with your busy schedule, you can meet a consultant in the comfort of your living room”</p>
<p>Another way you can give your copywriting a more personal touch is write about write about your readers’ challenges and frustrations. I particularly like using the <a href="http://copywritematters.com/pas-classic-copywriting-formula/">Pain Agitate Solve (or PAS) copywriting formula</a> for this.</p>
<h2>4. Share stories and experiences from other customers</h2>
<p>Reading about someone else having the same challenges will instantly connect your customers with your solution.</p>
<p>Testimonials and case studies show some proof that real problems have been solved, for real customers. And that’s what makes a business more credible to prospective customers.</p>
<p>Powerful testimonials cover areas like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How you helped them overcome their specific problem.</li>
<li>How much profit they generated as a result.</li>
<li>How the final product met their needs.</li>
<li>Whether they were surprised by the service delivery.</li>
<li>How they found the experience with you.</li>
<li>Whether they would recommend you to their friends or colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Believable testimonials also include as much detail as possible about the author of the quote (but be practical and sensitive to the amount of information people want to share about themselves).</p>
<p>Which is more believable?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Business Owner, 2011”.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Belinda Weaver, Owner of Copywrite Matters, August 2011”</p>
<p>If you can get a photo, even better. Video testimonials blow the roof right off.</p>
<p><strong>Case studies expand on the testimonial</strong> by creating a more detailed story. A strong case study outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge, trigger or problem that led to the connection between customer and the business.</li>
<li>The solution including the fix but also how the solution was delivered and any challenges that had to be overcome.</li>
<li>The result of everyone’s hard work. The more specific, the better!</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Use the same language as your customers</h2>
<p>Whether you’re getting down with the young folk or pitching to a blue chip corporate audience, you can build a connection and rapport but using the same language and tone of voice as your customers.</p>
<p>When I talk about tone of voice, I’m talking about how a business expresses itself through the written word. Tone of voice covers the actual words, the order they are presented and the rhythm, pace and cadence.</p>
<p><strong>It’s what you say and how you say it.</strong></p>
<p>Kate and I dedicated an episode of our Hot Copy podcast to the <a href="http://copywritematters.com/podcast/hot-copy-podcast/hot-copy-5-copywriting-tone-voice/">tone of voice in your copywriting</a> and it’s worth a listen.</p>
<h2>Over to you</h2>
<p>What do you think? Do you have any other tips you use to connect with your customers and make it all about them?</p>
<p>Like a prison escapee, dig deep and think outside the square to connect with your reader.</p>
