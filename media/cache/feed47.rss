				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d take a break from regular programming on <em>The Copy Detective</em> to introduce myself a little more intimately. You may know me from a while back but if you&#8217;re new around here, Welcome!</p>
<p>These are some things that you (probably) won&#8217;t know about me and that you might find interesting. Or not!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>My nickname is Bill and has been since I was 14.<a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Polaroids.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-4344 size-full" src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Polaroids.png" alt="Belinda Weaver - copywriting courses, coaching and consulting" width="222" height="505" /></a></li>
<li>My hair is naturally red.</li>
<li>During high school, I tap danced my way to teaching qualifications. I thought it would be a good back up career.</li>
<li>I’ve never had to rely on those tap dancing qualifications [thank god].</li>
<li>I have a frustrating and uncontrollable blush response.</li>
<li>I’m always surprised when people remember who I am [which makes me blush]</li>
<li>I’m super impressed when people remember my name [which makes me blush]</li>
<li>I am quite a show pony but I don’t like being the centre of attention [it makes me blush]</li>
<li>I don’t like being caught unawares [it makes me blush]</li>
<li>I am trying to get better at remembering people’s names using key facts about them. Unfortunately that kinda makes me look stalker-ish.</li>
<li>I remember all words to the brownie-guides song I learnt when I was 10.</li>
<li>I am getting quite good at yoga. Even if I do say so myself.</li>
<li>I have never broken a bone nor do I have any allergies.</li>
<li>I used to go to Johnny Young’s Talent School and perform in Brisbane’s Queen St Mall during school holidays *jazzhands*.</li>
<li>I have two [much] older brothers although they moved out when I was little so I have the selfishness of an only child.</li>
<li>My first concert was The Village People [expo 88] and I bloody <em>loved it</em>.</li>
<li>I am obsessed with all things Japanese.</li>
<li>I have several tattoos and some of them are quite big.</li>
<li>I just started wearing a watch after about 15 years without one.</li>
<li>I used to be a cat person until I owned a dog.</li>
<li>People think I’m brave and adventurous but I think they are completely relative terms.</li>
<li>I have a BA in Information Technology and I started my career programming software at a bank.</li>
<li>I am a completely hopeless romantic. Utterly hopeless.</li>
<li>I look for something positive in every situation [my husband calls it the PollyAnna syndrome].</li>
<li>I am very tactile and gesticulate quite madly when I talk, even when you can’t see me.</li>
<li>I’m quite (very) clumsy (see above).</li>
<li>When I walk around with my headphones in I imagine that I’m in my own music video.</li>
<li>I used to consume books at an extraordinary rate (until I had a kid!) and love rereading my favourites over and over again.</li>
<li>I lived in England for four years. I loved every minute of it but I was still happy to come home to Australia.</li>
<li>I’m currently living in California although, like England, it’s not permanent.</li>
<li>I’ll usually choose savoury over sweet. Usually.</li>
<li>I think of my favourite foods in terms of the texture they have. I love crunchy things.</li>
<li>I swear. A lot. But mostly privately.</li>
<li>The more excited I get, the louder I talk [which can make the swearing all the more inappropriate]</li>
<li>I am a terrible gardener [I kill with love] but I’m working on it.</li>
<li>I could watch Doctor Who over and over again. And then again. And again.</li>
<li>I am a self-confessed dork. And proud of it.</li>
<li>I am trying to overcome my fear of spiders so I don’t pass that fear onto my mini-Weaver. Thankfully, California does not have the spider population that Australia does.</li>
<li>I am definitely a gin and tonic girl. And a beer girl. I also love a nice mojito. [I’ll stop there before I look like an alchie].</li>
<li>I am very loyal to the people I love and I love people easily.</li>
<li>I tap my keyboard <em>really</em> hard and I don’t really know why. It’s clearly not necessary.</li>
<li>I am really proud of the work I do.</li>
<li>I just can’t seem to tick along at medium pace. I’m always putting more on my plate to see if I can do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are we friends now?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know some surprising things about you. Let&#8217;s get comfy and share!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Becauseblogpost.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8125 " src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Becauseblogpost.jpg" alt="Blog about powering up your copywriting" width="658" height="370" /></a></p>
<p>My two-year-old is upping her game on persuasion, and she recently hit upon one of the most persuasive words a copywriter can use to encourage action.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>Now, coming from my two-year-old, persuasion sounds something like this:</p>
<p>I want another cracker because I want another cracker.<br />
Or<br />
I want to watch TV because I want to watch TV.</p>
<p>Not very subtle, right? But studies have shown that the reason given actually doesn’t matter as much as the act of giving a reason.</p>
<h2>Let me explain.</h2>
<p>In the late 1970s, psychologists Langer, Chanowitz and Blank (of the Graduate Center, The City University of New York) ran <a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/copy-machine-study-ellen-langer.pdf" target="_blank">a language experiment</a>. It centred on a humble photocopier. Simply put, participants in the experiment interrupted someone about to start photocopying, asking to cut in the queue. The results measured how effective different ways of asking were.</p>
<p>There were three approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Request only.</strong> &#8220;Excuse me, I have 5 (or 20) pages. May I use the Xerox machine?&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Placebic information.</strong> &#8220;Excuse me, I have 5 (or 20) pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make copies?&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Real information.</strong> &#8220;Excuse me, I have 5 (or 20) pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I&#8217;m in a rush?&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>When the participants asked to cut in the queue without giving a reason, 60% were allowed to do so. When they explained why they wanted to cut in line, the conversion rate shot up to over 90%.</p>
<p>A quote from the study explains, “If a reason was presented to the subject, <strong>he or she was more likely to comply than if no reason was presented</strong>, <em>even if the reason conveyed no information.</em> Once compliance with the request required a modicum of effort on the subject&#8217;s part, thoughtful responding seemed to take the place of mindlessness, and the reason now seemed to matter. Under these circumstances, subjects were more likely to comply with the request based on the adequacy of the reason presented.”</p>
<p>So a mindless reason only works when the action requires limited effort, such as letting someone make 5 copies but not 20 (which is why Miss 2 often gets another cracker). But when the effort is great, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/iamcopywritematters/you-tube-benefits-vs-features" target="_blank">the reason has to be great too</a>.</p>
<h3>In either case, the linking word “because” is a persuasion-bomb.</h3>
<p>Let’s look at some examples that go beyond the world of a two-year-old.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Order now <em>because</em> we offer same-day shipping on orders before 2pm!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Come and see us in-store <em>because</em> we’re giving away FREE signed copies of the Sanity Saving Guide to Raising Exceptional Toddlers, while stocks last.</p>
<p>And not just for inciting some action. You can use this technique to reinforce the importance of your statement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://copywritematters.com/no-fail-tricks-for-customer-centric-copy/" target="_blank">These copywriting techniques</a> are essential because they remind you to focus on your reader.</p>
<h2>But wait; there’s more!</h2>
<p>You can also use explanations to offset negatives by explaining why something doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Orders cannot be cancelled.<br />
vs.<br />
Orders cannot be cancelled <em>because</em> we use express same-day shipping…and they&#8217;ve already been sent!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A 25% surcharge is added for urgent projects.<br />
vs.<br />
A 25% surcharge is added for urgent projects <em>because</em> we have to bump other projects to complete yours. And that means overtime.</p>
<h2>Ahhhh the power of because!</h2>
<p>Hopefully you can see how much this word can achieve in your copywriting.</p>
<p>If you find yourself needing to persuade your reader—and as copywriters, that’s our brief—give them a reason to say yes!</p>

<p>Understanding your reader and what motivates them is the key to effective copywriting.</p>
<p>When you can mirror readers’ thoughts and feelings, you show them that you <em>understand</em> them, and that generates feelings of trust and credibility. And when someone trusts you <strong>their barriers to your persuasion are way down.</strong></p>
<p>But understanding your audience can be hard. I mean, if they&#8217;re just like you, it&#8217;s easy but more often than not you&#8217;re writing copy to persuade an audience that&#8217;s entirely <em>unlike</em> you.</p>
<p>So how do you go about the task of understanding the why behind their actions?</p>
<p>This post covers three different lenses that can give you x-ray vision about your audiences&#8217; motives.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s begin with Bob Bly</h2>
<p>Copywriter Bob Bly (All Hail) has a fantastic list of motivators. He explains that people buy something:</p>
<table width="907">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="464">
<ul>
<li><strong>To be liked</strong></li>
<li><strong>To be appreciated</strong></li>
<li><strong>To be right</strong></li>
<li><strong>To feel important</strong></li>
<li><strong>To make money</strong></li>
<li><strong>To save money</strong></li>
<li><strong>To save time</strong></li>
<li><strong>To make work easier</strong></li>
<li><strong>To be secure</strong></li>
<li><strong>To be attractive</strong></li>
<li><strong>To be sexy</strong></li>
</ul>
</td>
<td width="464">

<p>It’s a great list isn’t it?</p>
<p>I really like the simplicity of these motives. We can all identify with them and they give us lots of different angles to work with.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s dig deeper into marketing theory</h2>
<p>In marketing theory, all those motives can be broken down to the five basic priorities that drive our decisions.</p>
<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MaslowsHeirarchyofNeeds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7976 " src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MaslowsHeirarchyofNeeds.jpg" alt="Maslows Heirarchy of Needs" width="742" height="462" /></a></p>
<h4>This is a classic marketing diagram known as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.</h4>
<ol>
<li>First we look after our physiological needs. We make sure we have shelter, food, water and warmth so <strong>we can survive.</strong></li>
<li>Once they are taken care of, we look to <strong>make sure we are safe.</strong> Safety could be lock and key protection or something more high-level like contractual safety.</li>
<li>When we can survive and we’re safe, we look to fill our <strong>need for social interaction</strong> and love. <strong>Following that, our self-esteem.</strong></li>
<li>Finally, when we have what we need to survive, we’re safe, we have a sense of belonging and our self-esteem is being taken care of… then we <strong>look to achieve our potential as humans.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Let&#8217;s end with some research</h2>
<p>The last model I want to share with you was created by Ernest Dichter, known as “the father of motivational research”.</p>
<p>He mapped out 12 motives that drive our desires, fears and our shopping:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Power/Masculinity/Virility</strong></td>
<td width="539">Strength and dominance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Security</strong></td>
<td width="539">Safety as well as home comfort</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Eroticism </strong></td>
<td width="539">Sexuality and desire. Sex sells!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Cleanliness/Moral Purity</strong></td>
<td width="539">Cleanliness isn’t just functional, moral purity is often implied in the colours and imagery used</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Social Acceptance</strong></td>
<td width="539">Companionship, approval and love</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Individuality</strong></td>
<td width="539">The desire to be unique</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Status</strong></td>
<td width="539">Feeling important, respected and successful</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Femininity</strong></td>
<td width="539">All things associated with being feminine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Reward</strong></td>
<td width="539">Maximising our payoff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Mastery over environment</strong></td>
<td width="539">Competence and mastery. Can be closely related to <em>reward</em> and <em>power</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Disalienation </strong></td>
<td width="539">The desire to feel connectedness to things. <em>This is often seen in fast food outlets. The food can be a little different around the world but there is a sameness that we crave.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="357"><strong>Magic and mystery</strong></td>
<td width="539">Powers unseen, surprises and moods</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>3 lenses = deeper understanding</h2>
<p><strong>The lesson: when you understand what <em>really</em> motivates someone to act, you can override their rational brain. </strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the one telling them NOT to buy. Instead, you talk to the little voice that’s <em>really</em> running the show.</p>
<p>Together, these models give you different lenses to see your reader through, which means lots of different ways to consider their motives.</p>
<h2>Your task</h2>
<p>Before you sit down to write a headline, call to action or an entire website of copy, take some time to consider what is <em>really</em> motivating your audience (beyond the obvious rational motives).</p>
<p><strong>And dig deep.</strong> Because the motives that live deeply within in us usually have the most power.</p>
<p>When you understand them, you can choose <a href="http://copywritematters.com/copywriter-words-that-sell/" target="_blank">copywriting language</a> that cuts straight to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>This blog is a little different to my usual posts about copywriting and being a copywriter. This post is a friendly request for your help.</p>
<p>And it will take <em><strong>less than 60 seconds</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ve managed to catch an episode of my <a href="http://www.hotcopypodcast.com/" target="_blank">Hot Copy podcast</a> with Kate Toon. We chat about copywriting techniques, business processes and life around being a copywriter. We also interview big names in copywriting and get them to share their tips.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty useful stuff. And our listeners seem to agree.</p>
<p><strong>If YOU agree, could you take a minute (and I really mean just 1 minute) to leave us a review on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hot-copy-podcast/id1015210035" target="_blank">iTunes</a> or <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/hot-copy?refid=stpr" target="_blank">Stitcher</a>? </strong></p>
<p>Not sure how? Here are <a href="http://www.hotcopypodcast.com/share-the-love/" target="_blank">some instructions</a> on leaving a review on both iTunes and Stitcher.</p>
<h2>The perks</h2>
<p>The perks of leaving a review are three fold.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">First, you get the warm and fuzzy feeling of being AWESOME.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Second, you help other copywriters find our podcast (more warm and fuzzies there).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Last, we read the reviews out on the show AND link to the reviewer so you can get a shout out for your business and a link!</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s serious warm and fuzzies and the chance to get a shout out on the show. And all for less than 60 seconds of typing.</p>
<p>Are you in?</p>
<p>Head to <strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hot-copy-podcast/id1015210035" target="_blank">iTunes</a> or <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/hot-copy?refid=stpr" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> </strong>now! Enter a rating (hint: 5 stars!) and some thoughts about why you like it. Easy peasy.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Samplesblogpost-noexperiencesign.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7692 " src="http://copywritematters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Samplesblogpost-noexperiencesign.jpg" alt="Samples blog post - no experience sign" width="516" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>When you’re just starting out as a copywriter, your empty portfolio can feel like a neon sign telling potential clients “I HAVE NO COPYWRITING EXPERIENCE.”</p>
<p>You feel like it’s the only thing they will notice about your beautifully written website.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to fill up your copywriting portfolio while you’re filling up your pipeline with actual clients.</p>
<p>One is <strong>approaching local businesses and offering your services</strong> in exchange for a testimonial and use of the piece in your copywriting portfolio.</p>
<p>Another is <strong>working with not-for-profit organisations</strong>, which are often crying out for help with their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>You can also <strong>accept copywriting projects from any number of freelance job sites</strong>. However, I do not recommend getting too embroiled in these sites. Some freelancers do very well, but when you’re competing against low prices, it’s a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>The option I want to explore in this post is <strong>making up samples for your copywriting portfolio.</strong> Yes, you read that correctly. Making up samples.</p>
<p>This actually came up in a recent coaching call for my Copywriting Master Class, and a student asked, “Is that legit? Can we just make it up?” Yes. You can just make it up.</p>
<p>Potential clients just want to see that you’ve written <em>something</em>. In most cases, they don’t care about the businesses behind the pieces they see in your portfolio. They just want to see <em>something</em> in that portfolio!</p>
<p><em>A quick aside: Don’t lose your mind over having an empty portfolio. The easiest way to get around it is to just leave that page off your website until you have something to show off!</em></p>
<h2>Where do you even begin making up copywriting samples?</h2>
<p>Whipping up an advertisement, brochure or website page sounds relatively easy, right? I mean, you’re a copywriter. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>So. Hard.</p>
<p>When I tried to do this as a newbie copywriter, I remember staring at a blank page wondering where the hell to start. My mind was blank. I questioned my skills as I struggled with this simple task.</p>
<p>I can confirm, with more than a few years of copywriting under my belt, that writing about a client who has given you a real copywriting brief is MUCH easier. So creating a copywriting brief is the first step.</p>
<h2>1. Write a fake copywriting brief</h2>
<p>My <a href="http://copywritematters.com/the-secret-to-mindblowing-copywriting/" target="_blank">copywriting brief</a> is very detailed. I ask clients <em>a lot</em> of questions because buried in the details of their responses is the gold that helps me differentiate their businesses.</p>
<p>This is where to begin your made-up project.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a business</strong> from a local business directory or your hood. Pool supplier. Accountant. Bakery. Whatever. Just keep it relatively straight-forward. Then <strong>fill out a </strong><a href="http://copywritematters.com/the-secret-to-mindblowing-copywriting/" target="_blank"><strong>copywriting brief</strong></a> for the company.</p>
<h2>2. Choose a type of copywriting project</h2>
<p>Will you write an advertisement, brochure, flyer, email or website page? These aren’t the only options of course, but they are the most common copywriting projects asked for and so make a great start for your fictional client.</p>
<p>You don’t want to make this harder than it needs to be, so keep it simple.</p>
<p>If you choose a brochure, make it relatively short. If you choose a website page, just write one page.</p>
<p>Remember, most clients just want to see <em>something</em>.</p>
<h2>3. Look at examples for inspiration</h2>
<p>I broke into a sweat the first time I had to write a small ad for a newspaper.</p>
<p>So much to say and almost no space! But looking through other ads gave me some reminders about the key elements to focus on. The same applies for a short brochure, flyer or an About page. This is exactly why copywriting swipe files are so damned useful.</p>
<p>If you feel a bit vomity when you start to write your made-up sample for your copywriting portfolio, just have a look at other examples and let the words flow from there.</p>
<h2>4. Write and edit</h2>
<p>This naturally is the hardest part of the process, but all the research you’ve done for your imaginary client will make the writing easier. And not just for this copywriting portfolio sample—for <em>all</em> your copywriting projects.</p>
<h2>5. Format it for your portfolio</h2>
<p>You might be wondering how much design work you have to do for your made-up copywriting sample. Don’t stress. Your focus is on the words, so formatting your sample in a word processing tool is just fine. However, if you’re whizzy with a design tool, go crazy!</p>
<p>Include a header that explains the business and some information about the project. For example,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Project: Website About page for a bakery</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Objective: To help customers feel like they know us when they walk into the store.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Project: Flyer for a newsagent</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Objective: To promote a sale on back-to-school stationery</p>
<p>When you do this, you are showing off that you write copy to achieve objectives!</p>
<h2>Your copywriting portfolio has its first piece!</h2>
<p>It’s nowhere near as hard as you might think. And once you go to the trouble of filling out that copywriting brief for your imaginary client, you may as well create a few pieces for them!</p>
<p>Then you can sit back and concentrate on bagging new clients knowing that neon sign in your copywriting portfolio has been taken down.</p>
<p>Will you use this process to create your first portfolio piece? Let me know how you do! And copywriters who already have a portfolio, how did you get your first pieces?</p>
